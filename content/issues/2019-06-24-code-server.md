We have released a new container for [Code-Server](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-code-server)!

[Code-server](https://coder.com) is VS Code running on a remote server, accessible through the browser.
- Code on your Chromebook, tablet, and laptop with a consistent dev environment.
- If you have a Windows or Mac workstation, more easily develop for Linux.
- Take advantage of large cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and more.
- Preserve battery life when you're on the go.
- All intensive computation runs on your server.
- You're no longer running excess instances of Chrome.
