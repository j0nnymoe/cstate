We have released a new container for [Beets](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-beets)!

[Beets](http://beets.io/) is a music library manager and not, for the most part, a music player. It does include a simple player plugin and an experimental Web-based player, but it generally leaves actual sound-reproduction to specialized tools.
