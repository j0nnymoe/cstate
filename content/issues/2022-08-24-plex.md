If you have a Plex account (not via OIDC provider like Google/Facebook/Apple) you will have recieved an email from them notifying you of a recent data breach and advising you to reset your password and force a logout of all connected devices.

Many users have found that after following these steps their Plex server no longer displays any of their libraries and may show an error in the container logs:

```text
#####################################################
#   Login via the webui at http://<ip>:32400/web    #
#   and restart the docker, because there was no    #
#      plex token found in the preference file      #
#####################################################
```

To resolve this issue, stop the container, edit `/config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml` and delete the following values if they're present:

* PlexOnlineUserName
* PlexOnlineToken
* PlexOnlineEmail
* PlexOnlineHome

Then follow the [claim process](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-plex#parameters) to add a claim token env and recreate the container.

You will also need to reauthorise any 3rd party applications, such as Tautulli & Plex Meta Manager.
