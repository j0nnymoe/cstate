We have released a new container for [Sickchill](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-sickchill)!

[Sickchill](https://github.com/SickChill/SickChill) is an Automatic Video Library Manager for TV Shows. It watches for new episodes of your favorite shows, and when they are posted it does its magic.
