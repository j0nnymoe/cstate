We have released a new container for [Emby](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-emby)!

[Emby](https://emby.media/) organizes video, music, live TV, and photos from personal media libraries and streams them to smart TVs, streaming boxes and mobile devices. This container is packaged as a standalone emby Media Server.
