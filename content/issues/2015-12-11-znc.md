We have released a new container for [Znc](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-znc)!

[Znc](http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC) is an IRC network bouncer or BNC. It can detach the client from the actual IRC server, and also from selected channels. Multiple clients from different locations can connect to a single ZNC account simultaneously and therefore appear under the same nickname on IRC.
