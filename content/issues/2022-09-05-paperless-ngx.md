Due to issues maintaining parity with the upstream container releases, we are deprecating our [Paperless-ng container](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-paperless-ngx/).

We recommend switching to their official container [Paperless-ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx)

While the volume mounts are different, it should be a drop-in replacement.
