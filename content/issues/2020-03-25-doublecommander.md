We have released a new container for [Doublecommander](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-doublecommander)!

[Double Commander](https://doublecmd.sourceforge.io/) is a free cross platform open source file manager with two panels side by side. It is inspired by Total Commander and features some new ideas.
