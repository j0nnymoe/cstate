We have released a new container for [Faster-Whisper](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-faster-whisper/)!

[Faster-Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) is a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper model using CTranslate2, which is a fast inference engine for Transformer models. This container provides a Wyoming protocol server for faster-whisper.
