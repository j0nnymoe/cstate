Due to issues maintaining parity with the upstream container releases, we are deprecating our [Papermerge container](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-papermerge/).

We recommend switching to their [official container](https://hub.docker.com/r/papermerge/papermerge).

Their documentation can be found [here](https://docs.papermerge.io/Installation/docker.html).
