We have released a new container for [Darktable](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-darktable)!

[darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) is an open source photography workflow application and raw developer. A virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers. It manages your digital negatives in a database, lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable and enables you to develop raw images and enhance them.
