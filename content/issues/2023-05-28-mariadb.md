There is a known issue with MariaDB when updating the container image to a new version. If a database upgrade is required and user databases are not in a healthy state, then the MariaDB service may fail to start.

MariaDB version updates (ex: `10.6.x` to `10.11.x`) can happen when updating the container image. Upgrading user databases is done manually by running a command.

When the container initializes, if `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` is set an upgrade check will run. If an upgrade is required the log will indicate the need to run:

```shell
mariadb-upgrade -u root -p<PASSWORD>
```

If user databases are not in a healthy state (sometimes caused by a failed upgrade), it may be remedied by running:

```shell
mariadb-check -u root -p<PASSWORD> -c -A # check all databases for errors
mariadb-check -u root -p<PASSWORD> -r -A # repair all databases
mariadb-check -u root -p<PASSWORD> -a -A # analyze all databases
mariadb-check -u root -p<PASSWORD> -o -A # optimize all databases
```

After running the above commands, you may need to run the upgrade command again.

If you have recently updated your container image and your container logs show repeating entries of:

```log
Caught SIGTERM signal!
```

- Roll back the container image to a previous tag (ex: `lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb:10.6.13` assuming this was the version you were running when things were last working)
- Run the check, repair, analyze, and optimize commands above, watch for any issues
- Update the container image to the new tag (ex: `lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb:10.11.3` or `lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb:latest`)
- Run the upgrade command above

This should get MariaDB running again with your user databases in a healthy state.
