We have released a new container for [Babybuddy](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-babybuddy)!

[Babybuddy](https://github.com/babybuddy/babybuddy) is a buddy for babies! Helps caregivers track sleep, feedings, diaper changes, tummy time and more to learn about and predict baby's needs without (as much) guess work.
