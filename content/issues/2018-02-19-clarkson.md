We have released a new container for [Clarkson](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-clarkson)!

[Clarkson](https://github.com/linuxserver/Clarkson) is a web-based dashboard application that gives you a neat and clean interface for logging your fuel fill-ups for all of your vehicles. The application has full multi-user support, as well as multiple vehicles per user. Whenever you fill-up your car or motorcycle, keep the receipt and record the data in Clarkson.
