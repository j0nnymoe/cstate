### Update

DNS propagation has completed and all services should now be accessible. If you're still experiencing connection issues please clear your DNS cache and try again.

### Original Post

Due to an issue with our domain registrar the lscr.io domain is has been unreachable for part of the day. The underlying problem has been resolved and we are now waiting for DNS propagation to complete so that we can resume normal operations.

If you are experiencing issues with pulling images from lscr.io you can use ghcr.io, docker.io, or any other mirror in the interim.
