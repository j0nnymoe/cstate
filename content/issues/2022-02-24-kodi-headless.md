Due to the lack of an active maintainer, we have made the decision to deprecate our [kodi-headless](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-kodi-headless) image. The image will immediately cease to be supported and will not receive any further updates.

Users of the image are advised to switch to [this fork](https://github.com/matthuisman/docker-kodi-headless) of the image by matthuisman instead.
