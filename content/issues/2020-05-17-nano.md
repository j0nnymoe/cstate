We have released a new container for [Nano](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-nano)!

[Nano](https://nano.org/) is a digital payment protocol designed to be accessible and lightweight, with a focus on removing inefficiencies present in other cryptocurrencies. With ultrafast transactions and zero fees on a secure, green and decentralized network, this makes Nano ideal for everyday transactions.
