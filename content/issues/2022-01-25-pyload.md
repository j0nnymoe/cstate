Due to a dependency on Python2 and Alpine 3.12, both of which are already or approaching end of support, we have made the decision to deprecate our [pyLoad](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-pyload) image. The image will immediately cease to be supported and will not receive any further updates.

Users of the image are advised to switch to our new [pyLoad-ng](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-pyload-ng/) image as a replacement.
