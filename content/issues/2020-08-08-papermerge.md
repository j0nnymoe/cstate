We have released a new container for [Papermerge](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-papermerge)!

[Papermerge](https://www.papermerge.com/) is an open source document management system (DMS) primarily designed for archiving and retrieving your digital documents. Instead of having piles of paper documents all over your desk, office or drawers - you can quickly scan them and configure your scanner to directly upload to Papermerge DMS."
