We have released a new container for [Endlessh](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-endlessh)!

[Endlessh](https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh) is an SSH tarpit that very slowly sends an endless, random SSH banner. It keeps SSH clients locked up for hours or even days at a time. The purpose is to put your real SSH server on another port and then let the script kiddies get stuck in this tarpit instead of bothering a real server.
