Due to the lack of upstream support and overhead maintaining our own fork of the codebase, we will shortly be deprecating our [Cloud9 container](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-cloud9).

We recommend looking at our [code-server](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-code-server) and [openvscode-server](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-openvscode-server) containers as potential replacements.
