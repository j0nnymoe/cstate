We have released a new container for [Calibre](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-calibre)!

[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) is a powerful and easy to use e-book manager. Users say it’s outstanding and a must-have. It’ll allow you to do nearly everything and it takes things a step beyond normal e-book software. It’s also completely free and open source and great for both casual users and computer experts.
