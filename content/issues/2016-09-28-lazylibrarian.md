We have released a new container for [Lazylibrarian](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-lazylibrarian)!

[Lazylibrarian](https://lazylibrarian.gitlab.io/) is a program to follow authors and grab metadata for all your digital reading needs. It uses a combination of Goodreads Librarything and optionally GoogleBooks as sources for author info and book info.  This container is based on the DobyTang fork.
