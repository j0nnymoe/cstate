We have released a new container for [Heimdall](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-heimdall)!

[Heimdall](https://heimdall.site) is a way to organise all those links to your most used web sites and web applications in a simple way.
Simplicity is the key to Heimdall.
Why not use it as your browser start page? It even has the ability to include a search bar using either Google, Bing or DuckDuckGo.
