We have released a new container for [Libreoffice](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-libreoffice)!

[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) is a free and powerful office suite, and a successor to OpenOffice.org (commonly known as OpenOffice). Its clean interface and feature-rich tools help you unleash your creativity and enhance your productivity.
