Due to the lack of upstream packages for 32-bit ARM preventing improvements to the image, we will be deprecating the 32-bit ARM (armhf) version of our [nzbhydra2 image](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-nzbhydra2) on 2023-03-31.

We will announce the last supported tag for 32-bit ARM at that time.

If you are currently running the nzbhydra2 image on a 32-bit ARM platform we recommend you look at alternative options such as upgrading to a 64-bit OS if your hardware supports it. Please see our [blog post](https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/end-of-an-arch) regarding our support policy for armhf.
