We have released a new container for [Piper](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-piper/)!

[Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/) is a fast, local neural text to speech system that sounds great and is optimized for the Raspberry Pi 4. This container provides a Wyoming protocol server for piper.
