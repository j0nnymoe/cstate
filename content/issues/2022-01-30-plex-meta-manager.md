We have released a new container for [Plex Meta Manager](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-plex-meta-manager/)!

[Plex Meta Manager](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/) is a Python 3 script that can be continuously run using YAML configuration files to update on a schedule the metadata of the movies, shows, and collections in your libraries as well as automatically build collections based on various methods all detailed in the wiki.
