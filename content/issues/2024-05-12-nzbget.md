As there is now an [actively maintained fork](https://github.com/nzbgetcom/nzbget), we have revived our container for [NZBGet](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-nzbget/)

[NZBGet](https://nzbget.com) is a usenet downloader, written in C++ and designed with performance in mind to achieve maximum download speed by using very little system resources.
