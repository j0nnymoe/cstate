We have released a new container for [Kanzi](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-kanzi)!

[Kanzi](https://lexigr.am/), formerly titled Kodi-Alexa, this custom skill is the ultimate voice remote control for navigating Kodi. It can do anything you can think of (100+ intents).  This container also contains lexigram-cli to setup Kanzi with an Amazon Developer Account and automatically deploy it to Amazon.
