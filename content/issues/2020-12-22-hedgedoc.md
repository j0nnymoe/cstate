We have released a new container for [Hedgedoc](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-hedgedoc)!

[HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/) gives you access to all your files wherever you are.

HedgeDoc is a real-time, multi-platform collaborative markdown note editor.  This means that you can write notes with other people on your desktop, tablet or even on the phone.  You can sign-in via multiple auth providers like Facebook, Twitter, GitHub and many more on the homepage.
