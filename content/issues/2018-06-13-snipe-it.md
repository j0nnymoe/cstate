We have released a new container for [Snipe-It](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-snipe-it)!

[Snipe-it](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it) makes asset management easy. It was built by people solving real-world IT and asset management problems, and a solid UX has always been a top priority. Straightforward design and bulk actions mean getting things done faster.
