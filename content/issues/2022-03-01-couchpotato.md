Due to the upstream project no longer being maintained, we have made the decision to deprecate our [Couchpotato](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-couchpotato) image. The image will immediately cease to be supported and will not receive any further updates.

Users of the image may wish to look at our [Radarr](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-radarr) image as an alternative.
