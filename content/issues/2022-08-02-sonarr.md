Due to the lack of reliable support for Mono on 32-bit ARM, we will shortly be deprecating the 32-bit ARM (armhf) version of our [Sonarr container](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-sonarr).

The last supported tags for 32-bit ARM will be `3.0.8.1507-ls151` for the stable branch and `develop-3.0.8.1540-ls294` for the develop branch.

If you are currently running the Sonarr image on a 32-bit ARM platform we recommend you look at alternative options such as upgrading to a 64-bit OS if your hardware supports it. Please see our [blog post](https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/end-of-an-arch) regarding our support policy for armhf.
