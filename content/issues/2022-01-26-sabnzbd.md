For operational reasons we will shortly be rebasing our [SABnzbd](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-sabnzbd) `unstable` tag to use our Alpine base image. If you use the image as-is this will not have any direct impact, however, if you make use of any customization scripts which install additional packages these may need to be updated to use the [Alpine packages](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=&branch=v3.15) and package manager (`apk`).
