We have released a new container for [Plex](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-plex)!

[Plex](https://plex.tv) organizes video, music and photos from personal media libraries and streams them to smart TVs, streaming boxes and mobile devices. This container is packaged as a standalone Plex Media Server. has always been a top priority. Straightforward design and bulk actions mean getting things done faster.
