Due to a lack of upstream support for Ubuntu LTS (Focal), we have made the decision to deprecate our qBittorrent Unstable image. Support and updates for the image will cease immediately.

If you are currently running the Unstable image we recommend switching to the Stable image. If and when the upstream project start building Unstable packages for Ubuntu LTS we will look to reinstate the image.
