We have released a new container for [Opera](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-opera)!

[Opera](https://www.opera.com/) is a multi-platform web browser developed by its namesake company Opera. The browser is based on Chromium, but distinguishes itself from other Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.) through its user interface and other features.
