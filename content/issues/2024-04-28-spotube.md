We have released a new desktop application container for:
[Spotube](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-spotube/)

[Spotube](https://spotube.krtirtho.dev/) is an open source, cross-platform Spotify client compatible across multiple platforms utilizing Spotify's data API and YouTube, Piped.video or JioSaavn as an audio source, eliminating the need for Spotify Premium.
