We have released a new container for [Chevereto](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-chevereto)!

[Chevereto](https://github.com/Chevereto/Chevereto-Free) is an image hosting software that allows you to create a beautiful and full-featured image hosting website on your own server. It's your hosting and your rules, so say goodbye to closures and restrictions.
