We have released a new container for [Projectsend](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-projectsend)!

[Projectsend](http://www.projectsend.org) is a self-hosted application that lets you upload files and assign them to specific clients that you create yourself. Secure, private and easy. No more depending on external services or e-mail to send those files.
