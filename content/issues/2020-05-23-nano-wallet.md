We have released a new container for [Nano-Wallet](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-nano-wallet)!

[Nano-wallet](https://nano.org/) is a digital payment protocol designed to be accessible and lightweight, with a focus on removing inefficiencies present in other cryptocurrencies. With ultrafast transactions and zero fees on a secure, green and decentralized network, this makes Nano ideal for everyday transactions.

This container is a simple nginx wrapper for the light wallet located [here](https://github.com/linuxserver/nano-wallet). You will need to pass a valid RPC host when accessing this container.
