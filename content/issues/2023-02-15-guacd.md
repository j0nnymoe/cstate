Due to a lack of upstream support for modern dependencies, we are deprecating our [guacd container](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-guacd/).

We recommend switching to their [official container](https://hub.docker.com/r/guacamole/guacd), though please note this only offers support for amd64 platforms.
