We have released a new container for [OpenVSCode Server](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-openvscode-server)!

[OpenVSCode Server](https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server) provides a version of VS Code that runs a server on a remote machine and allows access through a modern web browser.
