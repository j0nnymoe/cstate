We have released a new container for [Mullvad Browser](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mullvad-browser)!

The [Mullvad Browser](https://mullvad.net/en/browser) is a privacy-focused web browser developed in a collaboration between Mullvad VPN and the Tor Project. It’s designed to minimize tracking and fingerprinting. You could say it’s a Tor Browser to use without the Tor Network. Instead, you can use it with a trustworthy VPN.
