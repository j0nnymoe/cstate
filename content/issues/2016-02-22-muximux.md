We have released a new container for [Muximux](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-muximux)!

[Muximux](https://github.com/mescon/Muximux) is a lightweight portal to view & manage your HTPC apps without having to run anything more than a PHP enabled webserver. With Muximux you don't need to keep multiple tabs open, or bookmark the URL to all of your apps.
