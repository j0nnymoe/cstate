We have released a new container for [Webcord](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-webcord)!

[Webcord](https://github.com/SpacingBat3/WebCord) can be summarized as a pack of security and privacy hardenings, Discord features reimplementations, Electron / Chromium / Discord bugs workarounds, stylesheets, internal pages and wrapped https://discord.com page, designed to conform with ToS as much as it is possible (or hide the changes that might violate it from Discord's eyes).
