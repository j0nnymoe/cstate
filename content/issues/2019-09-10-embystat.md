We have released a new container for [Embystat](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-embystat)!

[Embystat](https://github.com/mregni/EmbyStat) is a personal web server that can calculate all kinds of statistics from your (local) Emby server. Just install this on your server and let him calculate all kinds of fun stuff.
