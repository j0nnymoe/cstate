A new fork, endorsed by the original author, has been established. We monitored the fork for some time and due to the activity level, have decided to bring back our COPS container.

[COPS](https://github.com/mikespub-org/seblucas-cops) stands for Calibre OPDS (and HTML) Php Server. It is a fast and light OPDS server that can run on low performance hardware.
