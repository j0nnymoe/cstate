We have released a new container for [Syslog-Ng](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-syslog-ng)!

[syslog-ng](https://www.syslog-ng.com/products/open-source-log-management/) allows you to flexibly collect, parse, classify, rewrite and correlate logs from across your infrastructure and store or route them to log analysis tools.
