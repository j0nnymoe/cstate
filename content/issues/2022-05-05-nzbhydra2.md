### Update

We have identified the root cause of the issue and documented the available solutions here: [https://docs.linuxserver.io/faq#jammy](https://docs.linuxserver.io/faq#jammy)

### Original Post

There is a known compatibility issue with our nzbhydra2 image Stable branch versions `v4.3.1-ls52` and later and older versions of the Docker engine on some amd64 platforms. If you experience Java errors on startup in the form of:

```shell
ERROR - Unable to determine java version; make sure Java is installed and callable.
```

Please ensure that your Docker install is updated to at least version `20.10.10`. We will update this issue as and when more information is available.
