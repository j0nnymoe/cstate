We have released a new container for [Bookstack](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-bookstack)!

[Bookstack](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack) is a free and open source Wiki designed for creating beautiful documentation. Feautring a simple, but powerful WYSIWYG editor it allows for teams to create detailed and useful documentation with ease.

Powered by SQL and including a Markdown editor for those who prefer it, BookStack is geared towards making documentation more of a pleasure than a chore.
