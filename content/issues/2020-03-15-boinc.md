We have released a new container for [Boinc](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-boinc)!

[BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/) is a platform for high-throughput computing on a large scale (thousands or millions of computers). It can be used for volunteer computing (using consumer devices) or grid computing (using organizational resources). It supports virtualized, parallel, and GPU-based applications.
