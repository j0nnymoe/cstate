We have released a new container for [Transmission](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-transmission)!

[Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/) is designed for easy, powerful use. Transmission has the features you want from a BitTorrent client: encryption, a web interface, peer exchange, magnet links, DHT, ÂµTP, UPnP and NAT-PMP port forwarding, webseed support, watch directories, tracker editing, global and per-torrent speed limits, and more.
