We have released a new container for [Ubooquity](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-ubooquity)!

[Ubooquity](https://vaemendis.net/ubooquity/) is a free, lightweight and easy-to-use home server for your comics and ebooks. Use it to access your files from anywhere, with a tablet, an e-reader, a phone or a computer.
