A [vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) has been discovered in log4j which can lead to denial of service and remote code execution. The following Linuxserver containers have been confirmed not to be affected by this vulnerability due to existing mitigations, upstream patches, or workarounds applied to the container images.

**Please note this applies to the latest versions of the below images *only*. If you are running older versions they may still be vulnerable.**

* [Unifi Controller](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-unifi-controller) (Workaround applied)
* [Booksonic Air](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-booksonic-air/) (Upstream fix)
* [Fleet](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-fleet) (Unaffected configuration)
* [Airsonic](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-airsonic) (No log4j-core in use)
* [HABridge](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-habridge) (No log4j-core in use)
* [nzbhydra2](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-nzbhydra2) (Upstream fix)

The following Linuxserver containers are known to be using a vulnerable version of log4j (again this applies to the latest version only). This does not mean they are definitely exploitable, but they may be, especially if exposed to the internet:

* [Davos](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-davos)
* [Booksonic](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-booksonic) (Deprecated)

The following Linuxserver containers are unconfirmed as to their vulnerability status, but are Java based and so may be using log4j in some capacity:

* [Ubooquity](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-ubooquity)

 We will update this post as more information becomes available.
