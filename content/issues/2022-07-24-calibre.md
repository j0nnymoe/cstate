With the release of Calibre v6.0 the project now provides official binaries for arm64 and has dropped all support for 32-bit platforms.

As a result our `latest` tag now supports amd64 and arm64 and we will be deprecating the `arch` tag in the near future. If you are currently using the `arch` tag on 64-bit arm please switch to `latest`. If you are using the `arch` tag on 32-bit arm you can pin to the `arch-version-79d7ec5e` tag but there will be no further updates provided.
