We have released a new container for [Paperless-ng](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-paperless-ng)!

[Paperless-ng](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng) is an application by Daniel Quinn and contributors that indexes your scanned documents and allows you to easily search for documents and store metadata alongside your documents."
