We have released a new container for [Duckdns](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-duckdns)!

[Duckdns](https://duckdns.org/) is a free service which will point a DNS (sub domains of duckdns.org) to an IP of your choice. The service is completely free, and doesn't require reactivation or forum posts to maintain its existence.
