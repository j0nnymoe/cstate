We have released a new container for [Ldap-Auth](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-ldap-auth)!

[Ldap-auth](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ldap-auth) software is for authenticating users who request protected resources from servers proxied by nginx. It includes a daemon (ldap-auth) that communicates with an authentication server, and a webserver daemon that generates an authentication cookie based on the userâ€™s credentials. The daemons are written in Python for use with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication server (OpenLDAP or Microsoft Windows Active Directory 2003 and 2012).
