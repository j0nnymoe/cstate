Due to a misconfiguration that occurred during a routine restore of the database for our [Discourse Forums](https://discourse.linuxserver.io/), registered users may have recieved unwanted email notifications over the last 24 hours.

This issue has now been resolved and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.
