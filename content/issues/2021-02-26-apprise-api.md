We have released a new container for [Apprise-Api](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-apprise-api)!

[Apprise-api](https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api) Takes advantage of [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) through your network with a user-friendly API.

* Send notifications to more then 65+ services.
* An incredibly lightweight gateway to Apprise.
* A production ready micro-service at your disposal.

Apprise API was designed to easily fit into existing (and new) eco-systems that are looking for a simple notification solution.
