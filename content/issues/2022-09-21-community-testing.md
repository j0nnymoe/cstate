If you've been paying attention you may have noticed the addition of a [#role-opt-in](https://discord.com/channels/354974912613449730/1020082397825478816) channel on our [Discord server](https://http://discord.gg/linuxserver). For now it has one purpose: to allow you to opt in to our Community Testing program, which gives you the opportunity to help us with testing PRs, new images, and other bits & pieces in exchange for our eternal gratitude and getting to play with new stuff before anyone else. See the post in the channel for further information.

DISCLAIMER: Everything provided to Community Testers is in a pre-release state and may change without notice and/or break all of your stuff. Don't use any of it in a production setup and don't use it with your existing live data unless you have good backups (which you really should have anyway). You may get pinged when new changes are posted for testing.
