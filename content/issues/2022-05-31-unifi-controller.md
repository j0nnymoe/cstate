As per our [previous announcement](https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2021-11-25-unifi/) today sees the deprecation of the 32-bit ARM (armhf) version of our Unifi Controller image. The last functional armhf tag will be `7.1.66-ls151`.

If you are currently running the Unifi Controller image on a 32 bit ARM platform we recommend you look at alternative options such as upgrading to a 64 bit OS if your hardware supports it.
