Due to ending of support by the upstream project, we have made the decision to deprecate our [Clarkson](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-clarkson) image. The image will immediately cease to be supported and will not receive any further updates.

Users of the image are advised to look at [Hammond](https://github.com/akhilrex/hammond) as a possible replacement.
