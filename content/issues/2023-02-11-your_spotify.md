We have released a new container for [your_spotify](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-your_spotify)!

[your_spotify](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify) is a self-hosted application that tracks what you listen and offers you a dashboard to explore statistics about it! It's composed of a web server which polls the Spotify API every now and then and a web application on which you can explore your statistics.
