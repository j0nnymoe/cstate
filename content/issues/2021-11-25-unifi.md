Due to a lack of upstream support for mongodb on 32 bit platforms, we have made the decision to deprecate our 32 bit ARM (also known as armhf / armv7) Unifi Controller image. We will continue to update the image until **June 2022** at which point it will cease to be supported.

If you are currently running the Unifi Controller image on a 32 bit ARM platform we recommend you look at alternative options such as upgrading to a 64 bit OS if your hardware supports it.
