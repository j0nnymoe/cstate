As [we](https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2023-04-06-armhf/) [previously](https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2023-05-06-armhf/) [announced](https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2023-06-06-armhf/), due to the ever-decreasing support for modern apps and packages on 32-bit Arm platforms, we have now deprecated *all* 32-bit Arm (armhf) versions of our images effective today, 2023-07-01.

Old images will continue to work, but will not receive application or OS updates, and we will not provide support for them. Additionally, the `latest` and `arm32v7-latest` tags will no longer work for 32-bit Arm, you will need to provide a specific version tag if you wish to pull one of the old images.

Due to the number of images and how our build pipelines work it may take several days for the builds to complete and documentation to update to reflect the changes.

Please read our [blog post on the matter](https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/a-farewell-to-arm-hf) for more details.
