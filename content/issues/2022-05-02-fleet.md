For operational reasons we will shortly be rebasing our [Fleet](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-fleet) container to use our Alpine base image. Please note that due to a lack of available OS packages we are no longer able to provide a 32-bit arm image. The last image tag to support 32-bit arm will be `2.3.2-ls115`. If you make use of any customization scripts which install additional packages these may need to be updated to use the [Alpine packages](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=&branch=v3.15) and package manager (`apk`).
