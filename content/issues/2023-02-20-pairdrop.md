We have released a new container for [PairDrop](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-pairdrop)!

[PairDrop](https://github.com/schlagmichdoch/PairDrop/) is a sublime alternative to AirDrop that works on all platforms. Send images, documents or text via peer to peer connection to devices in the same local network/Wi-Fi or to paired devices.
