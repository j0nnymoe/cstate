Due to [ending of support](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic#airsonic-isnt-maintained-anymore-you-should-migrate-to-airsonic-advanced-instead) by the upstream project, we have made the decision to deprecate our Airsonic image. The image will immediately cease to be supported and will not receive any further updates.

Users of the image are advised to switch to our [Airsonic-Advanced](https://github.com/airsonic-advanced/airsonic-advanced) image instead.
