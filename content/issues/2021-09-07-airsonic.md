As stated by the airsonic team [here](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic#airsonic-isnt-maintained-anymore-you-should-migrate-to-airsonic-advanced-instead), Airsonic is now no longer maintained and is recommended to use airsonic-advanced.
We're currently looking into creating an AirSonic-Advanced image and will post an update when this has been released. For the time being we will continue to let our airsonic builds update dependencies but once airsonic-advanced is released that will be stopped.
