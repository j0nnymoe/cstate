We have released a new container for [Lychee](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-lychee)!

[Lychee](https://lycheeorg.github.io/) is a free photo-management tool, which runs on your server or web-space. Installing is a matter of seconds. Upload, manage and share photos like from a native application. Lychee comes with everything you need and all your photos are stored securely."

### UPGRADE WARNING

Please note that the v4 upgrade process resets ALL password-protected albums. Any albums that were made public with a password will need to be re-secured.
