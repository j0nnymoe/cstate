We have released a new desktop application containers for:
[Ardour](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-ardour/)
[Librewolf](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-librewolf/)
[FreeTube](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-freetube/)
[KeePassXC](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-keepassxc/)

[Ardour](https://ardour.org/) is an open source, collaborative effort of a worldwide team including musicians, programmers, and professional recording engineers.
[LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) is a custom and independent version of Firefox, with the primary goals of privacy, security and user freedom.
[FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/) is a feature-rich and user-friendly YouTube client with a focus on privacy.
[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) is a free and open-source password manager. It started as a community fork of KeePassX (itself a cross-platform port of KeePass).
