Ubiquiti have released v6.2.25 to resolve the issues with their original broken release.

> Ubiquiti have pulled the v6.2.23 update for their Unifi Controller software due to issues with upgrading from older versions. If you have already updated your container image you will need to pull the re-released v6.1.71 and restore your config from a backup.
