Follow up for https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2022-11-27-nzbget/

Due to the upstream project no longer being in development, we are deprecating our [nzbget container](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-nzbget).

We are monitoring activity of forks of the original nzbget and may release a separate image if a viable option presents itself.

Please consider switching to [SABnzbd](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-sabnzbd).
