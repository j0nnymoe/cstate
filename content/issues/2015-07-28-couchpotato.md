We have released a new container for [Couchpotato](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-couchpotato)!

[Couchpotato](https://couchpota.to/) is an automatic NZB and torrent downloader. You can keep a `movies I want` list and it will search for NZBs/torrents of these movies every X hours. Once a movie is found, it will send it to SABnzbd or download the torrent to a specified directory.
